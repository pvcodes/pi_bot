To know more about bot commands visit [Command Docs](docs/COMMAND.md)

<h2> How to test the bot before running it on your server</h2>

To test the bot join the [Support Server](https://discord.gg/FjVVkTtbgp). And head over to the **\#playground**

## How to run the bot on your own server

[Invite the bot to your server](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=833191736335400970&scope=bot)
[_NOTE- While uing the bot if you find any issue or bug please head over to the [issue](https://github.com/pvcodes/pi_bot/issues) and create an new issue elaborating the issue_]

[NOTE- The music cog is not yet setup in the hosted bot]

## Hosting the bot locally:

**NOTE**: To replicate this bot, you will need a bot **token**. Go get yours at https://discord.com/developers/ (If you need help with this step, feel free to ask for help in our [Support Server](https://discord.gg/FjVVkTtbgp).

### For Database, It is implemented on [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), created a *cluster* and a collection named `server_config`



- Clone this repo using `git clone`
- cd into the bot folder.
- Add the token in a `.env` file in the project root as follows:

```text
DISCORD_TOKEN=<your token>
DB_CLUSTER=<cluster name>
DB_NAME=<db name>
DB_UNAME=<user who has access to db's username>
DB_PSWRD=<DB_UNAME's password>

```

- Install the `pipenv` via `pip install pipenv` an d then run:

```
pipenv install
```

### [Optional] For having contest reminder command working locally, you will need a login in [Google Cloud Platform](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and perform these steps:

- Get an Google Calander API
- Get the `credentials.json` from &nbsp; `APIs and services -> Credentials` &nbsp; click on CREATE CREDENTIALS and follow required steps
- Copy and paste `credentials.json` file to [src](/src) folder 

### [Optional] For having music stuff working (make sure you have [JVM](https://www.java.com/en/download/) working), Follow these:

- Run the command `java -jar Lavalink.jar`


- Enjoy! (don't forget to add your own bot into your discord server by generating an invite link from the discord developers application page in [OAuth2 section](https://discord.com/developers/applications/) and choose application and check Oauth2 section)
- You may do bug-reporting or ask for help in on the SupportServer... or just open an issue on this repo.
